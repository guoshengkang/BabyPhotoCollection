# BabyPhotoCollection
Crawing baby photos from Flickr, cleaning, clustering, and performance evaluation

I did this project when I join HP Labs as an intern from 2016.7.1 to 2016.8.19. This is a very wonderful working experience. If you are looking for an intern, you could contact me, and I would recommend you.

Plz note, due to the confidentiality, I will not make the dataset public.
