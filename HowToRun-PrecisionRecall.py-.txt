download Enthought Canopy with python 2.7 from https://store.enthought.com/downloads/#default and install it
download PrecisionRecall.py file from GitHub https://github.azc.ext.hp.com/qian-lin/Performance

click Editor and then open the PrecisionRecall.py file

clik the green triangle botton in toolbar to run the code, then you will get the result(two EXCELs and one TXT)

To run the code you have to make sure the following moduls are installed in the Canopy
numpy (already installed in system by default)
pandas (already installed in system by default)
matplotlib (already installed in system by default)
collections (already installed in system by default)
xlwt (this is the only one you need to install by Package Manager)

For install an module, you need to get access to Package Manager, then select Available option. Afet that, you can search the name of the module in Search Bar, then a search list will be given below. At last, you just need to select the modul in the list, and click Install below. 

For configuration, you only need to revise the code in lines 118-123.
lines 118-12 are as follows.
line118: groundTruthPath='C:\\HP_Data\\4recall\\CMU_Complete\\GallagherDatasetGT.txt' 
line119: rootPath='D:\\PFAP_results\\'
line120: endPath='\\clusterInfo.txt'
line121: resultPath='D:\\performance\\'
line122: aggSure=[0.60,0.65,0.70,0.75,0.80,0.85,0.90,0.95]
line123: aggStop=[0.45,0.50,0.55,0.60,0.65,0.70,0.75,0.80,0.85,0.90,0.95]

So you may need to configure the following parameter:
groundTruthPath--the path of groundTruth
rootPath--path of clusterInfo.txt 
for example, you have clusterInfo.txt  filesas follows.
D:\PFAP_results\0.60_0.45\clusterInfo.txt
D:\PFAP_results\0.60_0.50\clusterInfo.txt
...
you just need to set it as line 119
resultPath--set the path where the output files are saved
aggSure and aggStop--the two parameter should be set according to the parameter combinations used for clustering (they are also the folder names of clustering results)

Any comments are welcome.
